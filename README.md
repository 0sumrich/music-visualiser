# Webaudio-API Music Visualiser with D3
https://0sum.bandcamp.com/

### Tech
* [webaudio-API] 
* [Node]
* [d3]


### Development

I wanted to make a visualisation/animation for some music I had been working on as my music moniker [0sum](https://0sum.bandcamp.com).
I used the webaudio-API and D3 to create some timed bubble type visuals that are colour-coded according to their frequency.

#### Working Version
